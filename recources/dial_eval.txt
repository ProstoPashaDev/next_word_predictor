I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . <eos> <user>  We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? <bot> Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . <eos> <user>  The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... <bot> Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . <eos> <user>  That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? <bot> Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . <eos> <user>  What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . <bot> Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! <eos> 
<s> <user> Hi , my name is Tom . <bot> Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . <eos> <user>  Nice to meet you too.Melinda . <bot> Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department . <eos> <user>  Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . <bot> Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . <eos> <user>  It looks like you guys work hard . <bot> I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices . <eos> <user>  Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . <bot> Sure thing . <eos> 
<s> <user> What do you think of our price ? <bot> Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? <eos> <user>  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . <bot> I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . <eos> <user>  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . <bot> I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . <eos> <user>  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . <bot> Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? <eos> <user>  We've already cut down our price to cost level . <bot> Is that all ? <eos> <user>  Yes , this is the best we can do . <bot> I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . <eos> 
<s> <user> So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? <bot> It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . <eos> <user>  Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . <bot> I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? <eos> <user>  You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . <bot> But what if I need my money suddenly ? <eos> <user>  The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . <bot> Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! <eos> <user>  Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot <bot> OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . <eos> 
<s> <user> Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? <bot> Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . <eos> <user>  Which bus do I have to change ? <bot> You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . <eos> <user>  I see . Thank you . 
<s> <user> Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . <bot> Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? <eos> <user>  Sure . 
<s> <user> Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? <bot> We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . <eos> <user>  Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? <bot> Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . <eos> 
<s> <user> Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? <bot> Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . <eos> <user>  Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? <bot> Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . <eos> <user>  Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? <bot> All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . <eos> <user>  Okay , that's good . I get it . 
<s> <user> Kate , you never believe what's happened . <bot> What do you mean ? <eos> <user>  Masha and Hero are getting divorced . <bot> You are kidding . What happened ? <eos> <user>  Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . <bot> That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? <eos> <user>  Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . <bot> That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? <eos> <user>  Early in the New Year I guess . 
<s> <user> Overseas operator . <bot> I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . <eos> <user>  Your name , please . <bot> Tim Chen . <eos> <user>  What's the number , please . <bot> The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . <eos> <user>  The line is connected .

<s> <user> Hello . Excuse me . <bot> Yes . Can I help you ? <eos> <user>  Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . <bot> Of course I remember you . <eos> <user>  I think I lost my wallet here . <bot> Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . <eos> <user>  Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? <bot> No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? <eos> <user>  Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? <bot> No . It's been empty the whole time . <eos> <user>  Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . <bot> I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? <eos> <user>  No . My friend did . <bot> Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? <eos> <user>  No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . <bot> Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . <eos> <user>  I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? <bot> Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . <eos> <user>  Should I call the police ? <bot> You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . <eos> <user>  Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . <bot> I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . <eos> <user>  Thanks for your help . 
<s> <user> Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? <bot> Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . <eos> <user>  That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . <bot> It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? <eos> <user>  Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller .

No air-conditioner ! <eos> <user>  OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . <bot> How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? <eos> <user>  Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . <bot> Do you have a better plan ? <eos> <user>  All right , all right . 
<s> <user> Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? <bot> I am wondering if you do facial care ? <eos> <user>  Yes , we do . <bot> How much would it be ? <eos> <user>  From 200 to 800 . <bot> I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? <eos> <user>  No problem .

<s> <user> Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . <bot> It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . <eos> <user>  You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . <bot> The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . <eos> <user>  Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . <bot> To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . <eos> <user>  Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . <bot> It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . <eos> <user>  You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . <bot> While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately <eos> <user>  Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . <bot> Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . <eos>

<s> <user> Excuse me , Miss . <bot> What can I do for you ? <eos> <user>  I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . <bot> What's your flight number ? <eos> <user>  Flight CA216 to Chengdu . <bot> Yes , it's true .

<s> <user> What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! <bot> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . <eos> <user>  I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! <bot> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? <eos> <user>  I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . <bot> Well , now we're stuck .

We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . <eos> <user>  I have plenty of gas . <bot> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . <eos> <user>  So what can we do ? <bot> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . <eos> <user>  Alright . That's a good idea . <bot> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . <eos> <user>  Days ? <bot> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . <eos> <user>  Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . <bot> Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . <eos>

<s> <user> I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . <bot> Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . <eos> <user>  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . <bot> Do you sell direct to shops ? <eos> <user>  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . <bot> Do you keep a stock of these things ? <eos> <user>  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . <bot> That is , your commission . <eos> <user>  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . <bot> Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . <eos> <user>  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . <bot> According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? <eos> <user>  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . <bot> We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... <eos> <user>  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? <bot> Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . <eos> <user>  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . <bot> Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . <eos> <user>  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? <bot> Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . <eos> <user>  All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . <bot> Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . <eos> 
<s> <user> Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . <bot> Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller .

Do you have an order number ? <eos> 
<s> <user> Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? <bot> Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . <eos> <user>  Are the prices on the list firm offers ? <bot> Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . <eos> <user>  I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . <bot> All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? <eos> <user>  How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . <bot> I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . <eos>

How about we get a cat or a ferret ? <eos> <user>  We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . <bot> Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! <eos> <user>  I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . <bot> Yay ! <eos> 
<s> <user> Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? <bot> Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . <eos> <user>  From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . <bot> I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? <eos> <user>  Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , <bot> So who has to stay behind ? <eos> <user>  Well , first we ask for volunteers .

Please count it before you leave . <bot> Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much . <eos> 
<s> <user> Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . <bot> Do you have many different suppliers ? <eos> <user>  Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . 
<s> <user> Mary , can you tell me how you keep in shape ? <bot> You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise . <eos> <user>  Now , tell me what you often eat . <bot> I often eat fish and eggs . <eos> <user>  Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? <bot> Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much . <eos> <user>  What do you like to drink ? <bot> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . <eos> <user>  Whatever would you like to drink ? <bot> I drink a lot of milk .

E-mail me if you have any questions . <eos> 
<s> <user> Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? <bot> It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . <eos> 
<s> <user> We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . <bot> Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . <eos> <user>  Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? <bot> This is already our best price . <eos> <user>  But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . <bot> Well , what would you suggest ? <eos> <user>  Could you make it $ 4500 ? <bot> I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . <eos> <user>  Can we meet each other half way ? <bot> What do you mean ? <eos> <user>  Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? <bot> You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . <eos> 
<s> <user> I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . <bot> Yes , Ma'am .

I love it . <eos>

Here it is . <eos> <user>  Could I try it on ? <bot> Please do , the fitting-room is over there . <eos> <user>  It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ? <bot> I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ? <eos> <user>  OK . How much does it cost ? <bot> It's 486 yuan . <eos> 
<s> <user> Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? <bot> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . <eos> <user>  Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . <bot> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . <eos> <user>  The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? <bot> To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . <eos> <user>  That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . <bot> I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . <eos> <user>  Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? <bot> Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? <eos> <user>  Good . Friday morning at 9 .

Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . <bot> Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . <eos> 
<s> <user> Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ? <bot> I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up . <eos> <user>  Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . <bot> I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? <eos> <user>  Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . <bot> Ok . <eos> <user>  Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? <bot> Yes . <eos> <user>  Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . <bot> I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit . <eos> <user>  Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave . <bot> Ok , thanks doctor . <eos>

Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .

<s> <user> Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . <bot> Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . <eos> <user>  How long does it take to get there ? <bot> About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . <eos> <user>  Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! <bot> Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . <eos> <user>  Great ! I ’ ll take it . <bot> Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! <eos> <user>  I understand . Thank you very much ! <bot> Have a great trip . <eos> 
<s> <user> I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend . <bot> A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? <eos> <user>  The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . <bot> So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? <eos> <user>  It sounds like it will be . <bot> I really hope it doesn't get cold . <eos> <user>  That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . <bot> The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . <eos> <user>  That is true . The weather is constantly changing . <bot> It would be nice if the weather would never change . <eos> <user>  That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . <bot> True . Predictable weather would make life easier . <eos> 
<s> <user> Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . <bot> If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . <eos> <user>  Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . <bot> But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . <eos> <user>  I doubt that . 
<s> <user> Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? <bot> Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . <eos> <user>  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . <bot> What's special about these things ? <eos> <user>  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . <bot> Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . <eos> 
<s> <user> I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . <bot> You need to take a break , maybe a vacation . <eos> <user>  Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . <bot> Is that so ? <eos> <user>  Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . <bot> Have you decided ? <eos> <user>  Yes . I want to get a better job . <bot> Could you tell me why you want to quit ? <eos> <user>  I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . <bot> Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? <eos> <user>  I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . <bot> OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . <eos> <user>  Thank you so much for your advice . <bot> And every best wish for your new job . <eos> <user>  Thank you . 
<s> <user> The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? <bot> Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . <eos> <user>  Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . <bot> Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat . <eos> <user>  Let's put our suitcases on the rack . <bot> Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . <eos> <user>  All right . 
<s> <user> So , how should we get to the theatre ? <bot> Let's take the bus . <eos> <user>  I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . <bot> It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . <eos> <user>  It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . <bot> We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . <eos> <user>  Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . <bot> If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? <eos> <user>  We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . <bot> I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . <eos> <user>  Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . <bot> It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . <eos> <user>  Thanks , that was nice of you . <bot> See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! <eos> 
<s> <user> Let's go over this plan again . <bot> From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . <eos> <user>  And that is mostly flat , right ? <bot> Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . <eos> <user>  And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? <bot> That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . <eos> <user>  It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . <bot> Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? <eos> 
<s> <user> Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? <bot> I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . <eos> <user>  I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . <bot> Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . <eos> <user>  No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . <bot> All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . <eos> <user>  Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . 
<s> <user> It's time for bed . <bot> I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired . <eos> <user>  It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . <bot> I'm not going to be able to fall asleep . <eos> <user>  Why don't you try counting sheep ? <bot> I've tried that before . It really doesn't work . <eos> <user>  That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . <bot> Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ? <eos> <user>  If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . <bot> I promise I'll go to sleep soon . <eos> <user>  No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . <bot> See you in the morning . <eos> 
<s> <user> I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . <bot> How about your psychological resilience ? <eos> <user>  I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . <bot> How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? <eos> <user>  I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . <bot> You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . <eos> <user>  Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . <bot> Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . <eos> <user>  I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .

Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down .

Did I take a wrong turn ? <bot> I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . <eos> <user>  Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . <bot> It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . <eos>

They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . <eos> <user>  Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . <bot> No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . <eos>

<s> <user> Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? <bot> Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long . <eos> <user>  Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . <bot> That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . <eos> <user>  What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? <bot> Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . <eos> <user>  So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? <bot> Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . <eos> <user>  Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . <bot> After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me .

When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right . <eos> <user>  I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ? 
<s> <user> The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? <bot> I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself . <eos> <user>  So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? <bot> Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . <eos> <user>  How long did it take you to do the tiling . <bot> As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . <eos> <user>  I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? <bot> You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . <eos>

<s> <user> I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . <bot> We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . <eos> <user>  Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . <bot> I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . <eos> <user>  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . <bot> But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . <eos> <user>  I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . <bot> There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . <eos> <user>  Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .

<s> <user> I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! <bot> Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . <eos> <user>  He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . <bot> I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . <eos> <user>  I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . <bot> Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . <eos> <user>  Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . <bot> Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . <eos> <user>  I think that's a bad idea .

They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . <bot> I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . <eos> <user>  I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . <bot> all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . <eos> <user>  perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . <bot> I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . <eos> <user>  that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . <bot> you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . <eos>

Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . <eos> <user>  Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . <bot> In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . <eos>

Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl <eos> <user>  Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? <bot> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . <eos> <user>  Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? <bot> No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy <eos> <user>  If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? <bot> That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like <eos> <user>  Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? <bot> I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! <eos>

OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . <eos> <user>  Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . <bot> So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? <eos> <user>  Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . <bot> Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? <eos> <user>  No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . <bot> You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . <eos>

That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? <eos> <user>  Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . <bot> The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . <eos> <user>  Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . <bot> When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . <eos> <user>  How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? <bot> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . <eos> <user>  Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? <bot> I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? <eos> <user>  Very well , I will .

How's your project coming along ? <eos> <user>  The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . <bot> Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . <eos> <user>  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . <bot> Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . <eos> <user>  I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .

Anything I need to do ? <eos> <user>  Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? <bot> Is it urgent ? <eos> <user>  Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . <bot> Ok , I am coming . <eos> <user>  Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? <bot> Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? <eos> <user>  No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . <bot> All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . <eos> <user>  Of course , Diana .

<s> <user> You're finally here ! What took so long ? <bot> I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . <eos> <user>  It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . <bot> I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . <eos> <user>  perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . <bot> I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . <eos> <user>  It would be better for the environment , too . <bot> I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . <eos> <user>  Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . <bot> The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . <eos> <user>  Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . <bot> That's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! <eos> <user>  So , are you going to quit driving to work then ? <bot> Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . <eos> 
<s> <user> That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . <bot> I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . <eos> <user>  That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . <bot> Sure , for at least three thousand per month . <eos> <user>  That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . <bot> I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . <eos>

Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . <eos> <user>  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse <bot> what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? <eos> <user>  it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . <bot> I see , so it's similar to global warming ? <eos> <user>  they're related to one another , yes . <bot> I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . <eos> <user>  people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . <bot> people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . <eos> <user>  I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .

<s> <user> We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . <bot> I used to hold a similar job for six years . <eos> <user>  So you're quite confident in your experience and skill <bot> I think so . <eos>

I prefer flight at nine thirty . <eos> <user>  I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . <bot> No , exactly not <eos> <user>  How about afternoon ? <bot> Sounds not good . I won't take it . <eos> 
<s> <user> We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? <bot> Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . <eos> <user>  I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? <bot> I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . <eos> <user>  What about the cost of delivery ? <bot> We would like to do it in accordance with an F .

<s> <user> Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . <bot> Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? <eos> <user>  Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . <bot> I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . <eos> <user>  But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . <bot> Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . <eos> <user>  Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .

We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . <eos> <user>  Well I am used to that , Mr .

But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . <eos> <user>  That sounds ideal .

What's that ? <bot> Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy . <eos> <user>  What gift ? <bot> It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . <eos> <user>  You refused the gift ? That's terrible . <bot> I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . <eos> <user>  Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . <bot> That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . <eos>

The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . <eos> <user>  What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? <bot> Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? <eos> <user>  Yes , 20 % would be perfect . <bot> Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 .

Why did you buy a brick ? <eos> <user>  There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . <bot> And ? <eos> <user>  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . <bot> And it's a brick ? <eos> <user>  Yes . <bot> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? <eos> <user>  I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . <bot> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . <eos> <user>  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . <bot> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? <eos> <user>  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . <bot> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! <eos> <user>  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . <bot> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . <eos> <user>  You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?

I'll just stay here until you get back . <eos> <user>  So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . <bot> How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? <eos> <user>  I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . <bot> I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . <eos> <user>  I think that we should leave 10 % . <bot> $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . <eos>

Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . <eos> <user>  But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! <bot> Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it .

I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . <eos> <user>  Well . <bot> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . <eos> <user>  You mean you want to run the meetings ? <bot> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . <eos> <user>  Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . <bot> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . <eos> <user>  I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . <bot> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . <eos> <user>  I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "

It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . <eos>

I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . <bot> We need to find a good realtor . <eos> <user>  Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . <bot> What do you mean ? <eos> <user>  Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . <bot> But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ?

We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . <bot> And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? <eos> <user>  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . <bot> Why ? <eos> <user>  Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . <bot> Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . <eos> <user>  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . <bot> I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . <eos> <user>  Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .

Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ...

As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .

My wife has been bugging me about it .

It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 .

She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
